# Timebank Protocol

Open protocol for mutual-aid economies where value is tracked in hours instead of money.

## Problem

People can help but often lack budget. Communities need a fair system to exchange help using verifiable time credits.

## MVP

- Ledger format for hour transactions.
- Balance calculator (`npm run balances`).
- Abuse-resistant rule: no negative balances beyond configured threshold.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run balances
```

## Vision

Create a portable, auditable social economy layer for communities.
