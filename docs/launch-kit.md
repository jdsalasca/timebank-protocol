## LinkedIn post

Today I launched Timebank Protocol, an open protocol to help communities exchange value in hours instead of money.

The MVP includes a ledger format, a balance computation script, and a simple anti-abuse policy to protect fairness.

I’m looking for collaborators in mutual-aid, civic tech, and social innovation.

## Reddit post draft

Title: I made an open-source “timebank protocol” (mutual aid tracked in hours)

Body:
I built a protocol-first MVP for communities that want to exchange support without relying on cash.

Would love feedback from anyone working in community economy / cooperatives.
