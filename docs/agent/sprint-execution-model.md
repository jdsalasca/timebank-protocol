# Sprint Execution Model

Use this model for weekly multi-agent execution.

## Cadence

- Monday: select top P0/P1 stories and acceptance criteria.
- Daily: progress sync with blockers and dependency updates.
- Friday: quality gate, merge, release notes, and backlog refresh.

## Work-in-Progress Limits

- Max 1 in-progress story per agent.
- Max 3 concurrent high-risk stories per repository.
- Blocked stories must be escalated within 24h.

## Delivery Rules

- One primary objective per PR.
- No scope creep across unrelated modules.
- No merge without verification evidence.

## Quality Signals

- Story throughput (done/week)
- Blocker lead time
- Rework rate after review
- Incidents caused by merged changes

## Exit Criteria Per Story

- Acceptance criteria complete
- Tests and docs complete
- Rollback plan validated
- PR hygiene check passed
