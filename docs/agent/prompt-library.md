# Prompt Library

Purpose: high-signal prompts that force agents to implement production-grade changes with clear acceptance criteria.

## 1) Implement Story Prompt

Use when starting a story:

```text

Output:
- Files changed

- Risks and mitigations
```

## 2) Refactor Safety Prompt

Show before/after risk analysis.
```

## 3) Bugfix Prompt

```text
